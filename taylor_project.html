    <h1>The Taylor Swift Subreddit Loved My Project</h1>
    <p>
        I recently did a project that allows you to calculate <a href="find_favorite_taylor_album.html">your favorite Taylor Swift album</a>.
        Taylor has 10 albums, and fans love all the albums, so it is difficult to choose a favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result of posting the project to the TaylorSwift subreddit, here are some key metrics:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Got on the trending page for the subreddit</li>
        <li>Over 30k views</li>
        <li>Over 100 comments of people discussing results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I was very happy with the results, and I am glad that I was able to help Swifties find their favorite album.
    </p>
    <h2>Development Process</h2>
    <p>
        I started by making a quick mock with javascript, then posting a screenshot of the prototype to the subreddit.
        I got some initial feedback, and used that feedback to make important decisions.
        I was debating was whether to have the user rank every song sequentially, or to rate songs 1-5.
        The commenters overwhelmingly preferred the 1-5 rating system, so I went with that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the website was ready, I launched.
        To my dismay, the first couple comments were people who were confused about the UI.
        Version 1.0 of the site had an 'X' to exclude the song from the algorithm, but users were confused about the 'X' button.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I see these comments come in I am sitting in class, and I am frantically thinking about how to fix the problem.
        I decide to change the 'X' button to a button that says 'None'.
        I also change the position of the button and have 'None' highlighted by default.
        Then the user has the option of leaving it as 'None' or selecting a 1-5 rating for each song.
    </p>
    <p>
        Evidently, this UI was much more clear, because the confused comments stopped coming in.
        Instead, people started commenting about how they loved the website.
    </p>
    <p>
        In most cases, software is not perfect the first time you write it.
        It is important to get feedback from users, and to iterate on your product.
