    <h1>Quadratic Voting</h1>
    <p>
        Quadratic voting is a decision-making method for groups.
        In this post, I will explain how it works and its pros and cons.
    </p>
    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There are enough issues, and each issue is sufficiently inconsequential such that voters have a quasi-linear "continuation value" for retaining voice credits for future issues</li>
        <li>Voice credits are distributed fairly</li>
        <li>In deciding how many votes to purchase, each voter weighs the marginal cost of an additional vote against the perceived chance the vote will be pivotal in swinging the election</li>
        <li>Voters agree on the marginal pivotality <i>p</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        Let's say voters are voting on an issue, and they're deciding between X and Y.
        Each voter has a certain number of "voice credits".
    </p>
    <p>
        Each voter chooses some number of votes v<sub>i</sub>.
        A positive number means they want X, and a negative number means they want Y.
        A larger number, in terms of absolute value, indicates a stronger preference.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the sum of all v<sub>i</sub> is positive, X wins.
        Otherwise, Y wins.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each voter pays a cost according the following formula:
    </p>
    <p>
        voice credits = c(v<sub>i</sub>)
    </p>
    <p>
        c is a function that takes in a number of votes and returns the number of voice credits.
        Also, c must be differentiable, convex, even, and strictly increasing in |v<sub>i</sub>|.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember we have assumed that voters agree on the marginal pivotality <i>p</i>.
        Therefore, a rational voter will choose v<sub>i</sub> to maximize 2pv<sub>i</sub>u<sub>i</sub> - c(v<sub>i</sub>).
        Given the assumptions that voice credits are distributed fairly, society wishes to implement A when the sum of all u<sub>i</sub> >= 0.
        We say a vote pricing rule is robustly optimal if each voter <i>i</i> so that the sum of all v<sub>i</sub> has the same sign as the sum of all u<sub>i</sub>.
    </p>
    <h2>The Vote Pricing Rule</h2>
    <p>
        We have had all this talk about a theoretical vote pricing rule.
        We have also defined what it would look like for a vote pricing rule to be optimal.
        So what is the optimal vote pricing rule?
    </p>
    <p>
        It is actually very simple.
    </p>
    <p>
        voice credits = (number of votes)<sup>2</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Vote pricing examples</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <th>Votes</th>
            <th>Voice credits</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>9</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>16</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <h2>Proving Optimality</h2>
    <p>
        We have claimed that (number of votes)<sup>2</sup> is the optimal vote pricing rule.
        How do we prove that?
    </p>
    <p>
        The central idea is that quadratic functions are the only ones with linear derivatives.
        Therefore, a voter buying votes equates her marginal benefit and cost at a number of votes proportional to her value.
