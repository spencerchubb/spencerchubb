    <h1>How Bitcoin Works</h1>
    <p>
        You probably already know what Bitcoin is.
        In this post, you will also learn how it works.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Trust Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Trust is important when it comes to money, but not as important in other domains.
        Consider another application such as messaging.
        If I am sending a message to my friend, it would kinda suck if a bad actor interfered with my message.
        It usually wouldn't be the end of the world, but it would be annoying.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, what incentive would someone have to interfere with messages between me and my friend?
        In most cases, there would be little incentive.
        It would be bizarre for someone to go out of their way to hack my messages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Money is a highly adversarial domain.
        There is a large incentive to hack money.
        If you successfully hack someone's money, you earn money, so we need to trust that our money is safe.
    </p>
    <h2>How Trust is Instilled</h2>
    <p>
        In the case of U.S. Dollars, we trust that dollars are safe because the U.S. government uses violence to enforce the rules.
        If you steal money, you go to jail.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the case of Bitcoin, we trust Bitcoin for two reasons: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cryptography</li>
        <li>Transparency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I will expand on what these mean below.</p>
    <h2>Cryptography 101</h2>
    <p>
        I will explain the minimum of what you need to understand this post.
        I will also leave some parts out, because cryptography is a very rich field of mathematics.
    </p>
    <h3>Public and Private Keys</h3>
    <p>
        In cryptography, there are these things called public keys and private keys.
        You choose a random private key, and then keep it a secret.
        A private key is kind of like a password.
    </p>
    <p>
        With your private key, you can use a cryptographic function to generate a public key.
        The key generation function is one-way, which means that it is easy to go from private key to public key, but it is hard to go from public key to private key.
    </p>
    <p>
        Theoretically, it would be possible to derive the private key from the public key, but it would take so long that it is not practical.
        Therefore, we say that it is practically impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another special property of public and private keys is the notion of <i>signatures</i>.
        You can sign some data with your private key, and then anyone can use your public key to verify that the data was signed by you.
        And that can be done while keeping your private key secret.
        That is why one of the keys is public and the other is private.
    </p>
    <h3>Hashing</h3>
    <p>
        Hashing is a cryptographic function that takes some data and produces something called a hash.
        The hash function is one-way, which means that it is easy to go from data to hash, but it is hard to go from hash to data.
        Similar to the key generation function, reversing the hash function is theoretically possible, but practically impossible.
    </p>
    <h3>Nonces</h3>
    <p>
        A nonce is a random number.
        It is used in cryptography to make it hard to guess the input to a cryptographic function.
        For example, if you want to sign some data, you can use a nonce to make it hard to guess the private key.
    </p>
    <h2>What does Bitcoin guarantee?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            I am the only person who can spend my Bitcoin.
            In other words, nobody can steal my Bitcoin
        </li>
        <li>
            The same Bitcoin can only be spent once.
            The notion of spending the same money twice is called the double-spend problem
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How are transactions secured?</h2>
    <p>
        The first guarantee is that I am the only person who can spend my Bitcoin."
        How is this enforced?
    </p>
    <p>
        We use public and private keys to ensure that I am the only person who can spend my Bitcoin.
        When I want to spend my Bitcoin, I sign a transaction with my private key.
        Then, anyone can use my public key to verify that the transaction was signed by me.
        If someone tries to fraudulently claim that I sent some Bitcoin, others can verify with my public key and see that it's a lie.
    </p>
    <h2>What about the double-spend problem?</h2>
    <p>
        The second guarantee is that any particular Bitcoin can only be spent once.
        How is this enforced?
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's say I receive some Bitcoin.
        When I send that Bitcoin to someone else, that transaction is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain.
        The blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions.
        Then if I ever try to send that same Bitcoin, others will see that I already spent it.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the blockchain?</h2>
    <p>
        A blockchain is a chain of blocks.
        Each block contains a list of transactions.
        The blocks are chained together in a way that makes it practically impossible to modify previous transactions.
        In fancy terms, we can describe the blockchain as immutable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is very important for the blockchain to be immutable.
        If it was possible to go back and modify previous transactions, then I would be able to spend the same Bitcoin twice.
    </p>
    <h2>How are new blocks added to the chain?</h2>
    <p>
        Now you know that the blockchain is a chain of blocks, and the old blocks cannot be changed.
        You might be wondering how new blocks are added to the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are these things called miners.
        They are people or businesses who run their computers to compete to add new blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
        It costs money to run computers, so now you are probably wondering why people are willing to compete to add new blocks
        Whenever someone wins the competition, they earn some Bitcoin.
        So all these miners are mining as fast as possible so they can earn a Bitcoin reward as compensation for their mining.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you might be wondering what it looks like for a miner to win.
        The miner who wins is the one who finds a nonce that satisfies certain conditions.
        Miners are trying to find a nonce that results in a hash that starts with a certain number of zeros.
        The number of zeros is called the difficulty.
        The difficulty is adjusted occasionally such that blocks are produced roughly every 10 minutes.
        If blocks are being produced quicker than 10 minutes, for example, then the difficulty is increased, and the hash is required to start with more zeros.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to find this nonce, miners use a brute force approach.
        They try a random nonce, verify whether the hash starts with the correct number of zeros, and if not, they try another random nonce.
    </p>
    <h2>Why is the blockchain immutable?</h2>
    <p>
        The blockchain is structured such that the hash of the previous block is passed into the hash function for the current block.
        So let's say I try to modify a block from 10 blocks ago, and I claim that is the correct chain.
        Others can easily recompute the hashes and see that I am lying.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now let's say I am a little more savvy.
        To convince others that my version is the correct chain, I will find valid nonces for all 10 blocks.
        Through this process, it is theoretically possible to modify the chain.
        But for practical purposes, it is expensive to modify the chain, and after enough blocks have passed it is practically impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once a new block is added to the chain, it is in the miners best interest to try to add new blocks to the longest known version of the blockchain.
        If they win and add new blocks, they earn the Bitcoin reward.
        If a miner tries and fails to modify the chain, they are only hurting themselves by wasting time and money.
    </p>
    <h2>Transparency</h2>
    <p>
        Up to this point, we have been talking about how the blockchain is secured with cryptography.
        Now let's talk about how the blockchain is transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Everything I've talked about in this post is public information.
        For example, the original Bitcoin whitepaper can be found <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to that, the source code for the Bitcoin software can be found <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bitcoin is open source, which means that anyone can look at it.
        Anyone can learn, audit, verify, and judge to see if it is secure, and to ensure that people are telling the truth about what Bitcoin does.
        If you are up for a challenge, you can even look at these resources to verify that the information in this post is accurate.
