    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
    <p>
        I make no guarantees about the correctness or completeness of the information in my blog posts.
        I may be wrong about things, and I may change my mind about things.
        I may post unfinished ideas.
        Posting imperfect ideas is a good way to get feedback on them.
        And if I waited until I had perfect ideas, I would never post anything.

    <p>
        If you have suggestions, corrections, or would like to discuss, please let me know.
        I would like to be as correct as possible, although I believe that 100% correctness is impossible.
