    <h1>AR</h1>
    <p>
        I believe AR glasses will almost completely replace mobile and desktop devices.
        AR will be a better computing platform in every way, and there will be no reason to use mobile or desktop.
    </p>
    <h2>Would it be dorky to walk around wearing AR glasses?</h2>
    <p>
        Eventually, it will be normal.
        As new generations grow up with something, it is seen as the default.
        I know this because it happened with phones.
        When the iPhone was released in 2007, phones were ugly, and it was weird to be hunched over looking at a small rectangle.
        Now in 2022, it is completely normal to be hunched over looking at a small rectangle.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other factor is that glasses would be much less nerdy than phones.
        If you can do all the same computing with glasses, you can maintain a posture that exudes confidence rather than nerdiness.
    </p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>
        There are many features that would be enabled by AR glasses that are otherwise impossible with mobile or desktop devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        The software would be able to draw UI components that interact with the environment.
        For example, it could display information about anything you want to know about.
        Information about people, buildings, and objects could be embedded next to them.
        Map software could be overlay your route on the road so you don't have to look back and forth between the map and the road.
    </p>
    <p>
        The available area for UI would be much larger than a phone or desktop.
        It would essentially be like having a screen as large as your field of view.
    </p>
    <h2>Caveat: Cost and Low-Income Areas</h2>
    <p>
        Today, there are many regions of the world where people can afford cheap phones, but not a desktop.
        I think this could be an exception to my prediction.
