    <h1>Neural Net</h1>
    <p>My goal is to make this the clearest explanation on the entire internet of how neural networks work.</p>
    <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
    <p>
        Maybe you're interested in neural networks, but don't understand them.
        Maybe you've tried using something like pytorch, but want to understand the underlying math.
        If you fit that description, this is for you!
        I am going to explain the concepts and math for neural networks, and I will show code.
    </p>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic python</li>
        <li>At least know what a neural net is</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What actually <i>is</i> a neural net?</h2>
    <p>
        It's a function, and it maps inputs to outputs.
        That's it.
        One type of neural net is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
        From now on, I will mostly discuss MLPs.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the function?</h2>
    <p>A neural network can be represented as a network of neurons.</p>
