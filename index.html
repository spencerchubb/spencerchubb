            Hi there! I'm an undergrad computer science student at Rose-Hulman. This summer (2021) I am going to be an intern
            as an application developer at State FarmÂ® Insurance.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spend some of my free time working on coding projects with my friends. When we didn't have much to do
            during the initial pandemic lockdown, my friends and I worked on a mental health startup called Hespr.
            Another one of my biggest interests is the Rubik's Cube. I've been cubing for about 8 years, solved many
            puzzles, and even won some competitions and awards along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my favorite technologies at the moment is Flutter, which is a cross-platform UI toolkit. Hespr was
            programmed in Flutter and I also did a hackathon project in this framework.
