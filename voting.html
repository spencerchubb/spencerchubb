    <h1>Voting</h1>
    <p>
        Voting is one way for groups of people to make choices.
        There are other ways for groups of people to make choices, such as by having a dictator who makes choices.
        In this post, I discuss voting systems.
        Some questions I am interested in:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How can groups of people make optimal decisions?</li>
        <li>How can we make voting systems efficient?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Arrow's Impossibility Theorem</h2>
    <p>
        Arrow's impossibility theorem states that when voters have three or more options, there is no ranked voting system that satisfies the following properties:
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Property</th>
                <th>Definition</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Complete and transitive</td>
                <td>All options are ranked in order. To satisfy this property, there must be no circular ties, such as in rock-paper-scissors (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Unrestricted domain</td>
                <td>All voters have a say</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Non-dictatorship</td>
                <td>The decision is not left up to a single person, or in other words, there is no dictator</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pareto efficiency</td>
                <td>Nobody can be made better off without making someone else worse off</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Independence of irrelevant alternatives</td>
                <td>This one is hard to explain, so see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives#In_social_choice">here</a></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
